# ParkMate - Smart Parking System

## Problem Statement

Tired of finding parking spaces whenever you to any market or any place in your city?

## Our Solution

Our project ParkMate helps you to find out the nearest available parking spot.
The project is divided into three parts :

1. Open Parking spaces in the city which is represented by the board (Parking A, B and C). From here the video input is taken which is then fed into the Raspberry Pi.
2. Raspberry Pi 3b+ runs the ML Model which based upon Colour Detection finds the number of empty parking spots and simultaneously this data is pushed into Cloud Firestore (Backend - Firebase).
3. Finally the data is fetched from Firebase in real time to the mobile app ParkMate which displays the vacant parking spaces near to you. 

## Sailent Features of Our Project

1. You can also navigate via Google Maps by clicking on the location icon.
2. You can reserve your parking space in advance and cancel it anytime (Feature is still under improvement).
3. Extremely cost efficient.
